  Add button creates a new chat and anyone including people that are logged off can chat. The chat is a type in the tables.py called textBox and my current idea for storing the text is using an array. The 'chat' Field is an Array and any new line that someone sends into the chat will be stored as an new index in the array. The Chat as of now CANNOT update its text UNLESS the send button is clicked OR the page is refreshed. 

PROBLEM:

  (SOLVED) id of textBox is always null. As a result, I can only edit one textBox right now.                                               
  (SOLVED) Currently, the array 'chat' CANNOT be displayed. As a result, I cannot work on the edit chat too. Someone fix please.

  Frank: UI looks like complete shit right now. You will need to change myapp.css, layout.html, and index.html to improve upon the website design.

  Kyler: Look into the scroll wheel for the chatbox.
